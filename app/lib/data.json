			"pairingText": "Salmon works really well with Pinot Noir, Alcoholic Drink, and White Wine. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. One wine you could try is Beaux Freres Willamette Valley Pinot Noir. It has 4.7 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 50 dollars.",

		"instructions": "Heat the oven to 400F. Pulse the bread in a food processor to make breadcrumbs. Remove about 1/2 cup of the crumbs and reserve them. Add the pine nuts, garlic, 1 tsp. salt, and 1/4 tsp. pepper to the crumbs in the food processor and pulse. Add the basil and process again. With the motor running, add the olive oil in a slow stream, stopping occasionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl, until the pesto is spreadable.        Brush a small baking sheet with oil, put the fillets on it, and season them with salt and pepper. Spread a 1/4-inch layer of the pesto evenly over the top of each fillet. Sprinkle the reserved breadcrumbs over the pesto. Bake until the salmon is cooked -- it should just start to turn opaque, with a trace of bright orange in the middle -- and the topping is lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fish.                  nutrition information (per serving):        Calories                        (kcal):                      500, Fat                        (kcal):                      33, Fat Calories                        (g):                      300, Saturated Fat                        (g):                      5, Protein                        (g):                      37, Monounsaturated Fat                        (g):                      19, Carbohydrates                        (mg):                      13, Polyunsaturated Fat                        (mg):                      7, Sodium                        (g):                      770, Cholesterol                        (g):                      95, Fiber                        (g):                      2,                     Photo: Scott Phillips          Rate this Recipe and View Reviews",
